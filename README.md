# mosaic


Mosaic is a set of tools for computing angular power spectra in healpix and CAR pixellisation using the Master algorithm (arxiv:0105302).
It makes heavy use of healpix function (https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) and enlib function (see Sigurd Naess github: https://github.com/amaurea), and has benefited from Eiichiro Komatsu tools (https://www.mpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/), SPHT are performed using libsharp (arXiv:1303.4945) so we are especially thankful to Martin Reinecke and Dag Sverre Seljebotn.
The code also allows to make comparison with NaMaster (see David Alonso github: https://github.com/damonge/).
While the bugs are all on me, special thanks for Sigurd Naess for help with the code.
