# mosaic

This is mosaic.
Its a set of tools for computing power spectrum in healpix and CAR.
The code makes heavy use of healpix function and enlib function (see Sigurd Naess github), and has benefited from Eiichiro Komatsu tools (https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/), SPHT are performed using libsharp (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.4945.pdf)
The code also allows to make comparison with NaMaster (see David Alonso github).
The doc is in construction but will be available soon !
